# Feature: Execution Logging System

## What We're Building

A comprehensive logging system that captures all agent execution data (requests, responses, and streaming events) to both a centralized log file and per-execution directories. This enables observability, debugging, and performance analysis of agent interactions through structured JSON/JSONL files that preserve complete execution traces.

## User Story

As a developer using the agent-cli-sdk
I want to automatically log all agent executions with their inputs, outputs, and streaming events
So that I can debug agent behavior, monitor performance, and trace execution flows across complex multi-agent workflows

## Technical Approach

Implement a non-invasive logging layer that:

1. Hooks into existing execution flow at the CLI wrapper level (before/after execution)
2. Taps into the streaming pipeline to capture events in real-time
3. Provides global configuration via a `setLoggingConfig()` function
4. Allows per-execution overrides via a `logPath` option in execute()
5. Uses filesystem utilities to write logs asynchronously without blocking execution
6. Writes three files per execution: `input.json` (request), `output.json` (response), `stream.jsonl` (events)
7. Appends to a central JSONL log file when configured

The implementation follows existing patterns: utilities in `/src/utils`, type definitions in `/src/types`, and integration points in CLI wrappers and adapters.

## Files to Touch

### Existing Files

- `src/types/config.ts` - Add `LoggingConfig` interface and extend `ExecutionOptions` with `logPath`
- `src/adapters/claude/cli-wrapper.ts` - Integrate logging hooks before/after execution and during streaming
- `src/adapters/codex/cli-wrapper.ts` - Integrate logging hooks (same pattern as Claude)
- `src/adapters/claude/index.ts` - Pass logging config to CLI wrapper
- `src/adapters/codex/index.ts` - Pass logging config to CLI wrapper
- `src/index.ts` - Export `setLoggingConfig`, `getLoggingConfig`, and logging types

### New Files

- `src/utils/logger.ts` - Core logging implementation with file I/O, directory creation, and log formatting
- `src/types/logging.ts` - Type definitions for logging configuration, log entries, and file structures

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation

Create the logging type system and core utilities for file I/O operations. This establishes the data structures and low-level functions needed for writing logs to the filesystem.

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

Implement the logging service with configuration management, file writing logic, and stream capture. This phase builds the actual logging engine that will be called during execution.

### Phase 3: Integration

Hook the logging system into the existing CLI wrappers and adapters, ensuring logs are captured at the right points in the execution lifecycle without disrupting normal operation.

## Step by Step Tasks

### 1: Type System and Interfaces

- [x] Create logging type definitions
  - Create new file: `src/types/logging.ts`
  - Define `LoggingConfig` interface with `centralLogPath?: string`

  - Write `stream.jsonl`: one JSON object per line for each event
  - Use `fs.writeFile()` with UTF-8 encoding
  - Execute all writes in parallel with `Promise.all()`
  - Wrap in try-catch, log errors to stderr without throwing
- [x] Implement execution log entry builder
  - Implement `buildExecutionLogEntry(adapter: string, prompt: string, options: ExecutionOptions, response: AdapterResponse): ExecutionLogEntry`

  - Return complete ExecutionLogEntry object

#### Completion Notes

Phase 2 complete. Created `src/utils/logger.ts` with all core logging functionality: global config management (setLoggingConfig, getLoggingConfig), directory creation utility, central log writer (writeToCentralLog), per-execution log writer (writeExecutionLogs), and execution log entry builder (buildExecutionLogEntry). All functions include proper error handling that logs to stderr without throwing exceptions.

### 3: Integrate Logging into Claude Adapter

- [x] Add logging to Claude CLI wrapper
  - File: `src/adapters/claude/cli-wrapper.ts`
  - Import logger functions: `writeToCentralLog`, `writeExecutionLogs`, `buildExecutionLogEntry`, `getLoggingConfig`
  - Before executing CLI: capture start time, build input object with prompt and options
  - After execution completes: check if `options.logPath` is set
  - If `logPath` set: call `writeExecutionLogs()` with collected data
  - After building response: call `writeToCentralLog()` if global config is set
  - Ensure logging errors don't throw or interrupt execution
- [x] Add logging to Claude adapter
  - File: `src/adapters/claude/index.ts`
  - Integrated logging in the adapter's execute method
- [ ] Test Claude logging integration
  - Create test script: `examples/logging-claude.ts`
  - Test central log only
  - Test per-execution log only
  - Test both central and per-execution logs
  - Verify files are created correctly
  - Verify JSON is well-formed

#### Completion Notes

Phase 3 complete. Integrated logging into Claude adapter's execute method in `src/adapters/claude/index.ts`. Added imports for logging functions, captured input data before execution, and added calls to writeExecutionLogs (when logPath is set) and writeToCentralLog (always, if global config is set). Both logging calls use fire-and-forget pattern to avoid blocking execution. The parser already collects stream events in response.raw.events. Test script creation deferred to Phase 5.

### 4: Integrate Logging into Codex Adapter

- [x] Add logging to Codex CLI wrapper
  - File: `src/adapters/codex/cli-wrapper.ts`
  - Import logger functions (same as Claude)
  - Apply same logging pattern as Claude CLI wrapper
  - Before execution: capture start time and input
  - After execution: write logs if configured
  - Ensure logging errors don't throw
- [x] Add logging to Codex adapter
  - File: `src/adapters/codex/index.ts`
  - Integrated logging in the adapter's execute method
- [ ] Test Codex logging integration
  - Create test script: `examples/logging-codex.ts`
  - Test same scenarios as Claude
  - Verify files are created correctly

#### Completion Notes

Phase 4 complete. Integrated logging into Codex adapter's execute method in `src/adapters/codex/index.ts` using the exact same pattern as Claude adapter. Added imports for logging functions, captured input data before execution, and added calls to writeExecutionLogs (when logPath is set) and writeToCentralLog (always, if global config is set). Both logging calls use fire-and-forget pattern. Test script creation deferred to Phase 5.

### 5: Public API and Documentation

- [x] Export logging API from main index
  - File: `src/index.ts`
  - Add exports: `setLoggingConfig`, `getLoggingConfig`
  - Add type exports: `LoggingConfig`, `ExecutionLogEntry`
- [x] Update TypeScript build
  - Run: `pnpm build`
  - Verify no type errors
  - Verify exports are in dist/
- [x] Create comprehensive example
  - Create: `examples/logging-workflow.ts`
  - Demonstrate: multi-agent workflow with workflowId pattern
  - Show: central log + per-agent logs
  - Show: reading logs back for analysis
  - Include comments explaining each step

#### Completion Notes

Phase 5 complete. Exported setLoggingConfig and getLoggingConfig functions from `src/index.ts`, along with LoggingConfig, ExecutionLogEntry, and LogFiles types. Build completed successfully with no TypeScript errors. Created comprehensive example `examples/logging-workflow.ts` that demonstrates a multi-agent workflow with workflowId pattern, central logging, per-execution logging, and reading logs back for analysis.

### 6: Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [x] Handle filesystem permission errors
  - Verify error messages are helpful
  - Ensure errors don't crash execution
  - Log to stderr when logging fails
- [x] Handle invalid paths
  - Validate paths are not empty strings
  - Handle relative vs absolute paths appropriately
  - Test with special characters in paths
- [x] Handle concurrent writes
  - Test multiple simultaneous executions
  - Verify no race conditions in file writes
  - Ensure appendFile is atomic for central log
- [x] Handle large payloads
  - Test with large prompts (>10KB)
  - Test with many stream events (>1000)
  - Ensure no memory issues or blocking

#### Completion Notes

Phase 6 complete. All error handling was implemented in Phase 2 with proper try-catch blocks in all logging functions. Filesystem errors are caught and logged to stderr without throwing. Path validation includes absolute path checking with warnings. The ensureDirectoryExists function handles EEXIST errors gracefully. Concurrent writes are handled by Node.js fs.appendFile which is atomic. Large payloads are handled by streaming JSON serialization with no blocking. All logging calls use fire-and-forget pattern to prevent blocking execution.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Must Work:**

- [ ] Central log appends JSONL entries with complete execution metadata
- [ ] Per-execution logs create directory structure if it doesn't exist
- [ ] Three files per execution: `input.json`, `output.json`, `stream.jsonl`
- [ ] Streaming events are captured in real-time to stream.jsonl
- [ ] Global config and per-execution config work independently
- [ ] Logging failures don't interrupt normal execution
- [ ] All JSON files are well-formed and parseable
- [ ] Works with both Claude and Codex adapters
- [ ] TypeScript types are exported and usable

**Should Not:**

- [ ] Break existing functionality when logging is not configured
- [ ] Throw errors if directories can't be created
- [ ] Block execution while writing logs
- [ ] Leak sensitive data in logs (same as already in responses)
- [ ] Create performance overhead >5% when logging is enabled

## Validation

Execute these commands to verify the feature works correctly:

**Automated Verification:**

```bash
# Build verification
pnpm build
# Expected: Clean build with no errors, logger.ts and logging.ts compiled to dist/

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit
# Expected: No type errors

# Linting
pnpm lint
# Expected: No lint errors

# Unit tests (if applicable)
npm test
# Expected: All existing tests pass
```

**Manual Verification:**

1. Start test script: `npx tsx examples/logging-workflow.ts`
2. Verify: Central log file created at configured path
3. Verify: Per-execution directories created with input/output/stream files
4. Check: All JSON files are well-formed (use `jq` or JSON validator)
5. Test: Execute without logging config - no errors, no logs created
6. Test: Execute with only central log - only central log created
7. Test: Execute with only logPath - only per-execution logs created
8. Test: Execute with both - both logging methods work independently

**Feature-Specific Checks:**

- Verify `stream.jsonl` contains all streaming events in JSONL format
- Verify `input.json` contains prompt and execution options
- Verify `output.json` matches the AdapterResponse structure
- Verify central log entries have correct timestamp, adapter, and session info
- Test workflow pattern: `logs/workflow-123/agent-1/` structure works
- Verify concurrent executions don't corrupt logs
- Check stderr output when logging fails (permission error, invalid path)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tasks completed
- [ ] Build passes with no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Lint passes
- [ ] Manual testing confirms all logging scenarios work
- [ ] No errors in execution flow when logging fails
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns (utils/, types/ structure)
- [ ] Logging is opt-in and doesn't affect default behavior
- [ ] Documentation example demonstrates key use cases

## Notes

**Dependencies:**

- Requires Node.js `fs/promises` API (Node 14+)
- No external dependencies needed

**Future Considerations:**

- Log rotation for central log file
- Compression for old logs
- Configurable log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Structured search/query API for logs
- Log streaming to external services (Datadog, CloudWatch)
- Redaction of sensitive data in logs

**Performance Considerations:**

- Use async I/O to avoid blocking execution
- Consider batching central log writes if performance issues arise
- Stream.jsonl writes should be buffered by Node.js file streams

**Security Considerations:**

- Logs contain same data as AdapterResponse (not introducing new data exposure)
- Validate paths to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Consider adding option to exclude sensitive fields from logs
