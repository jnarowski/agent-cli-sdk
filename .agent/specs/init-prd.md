# CLI Orchestration SDK PRD

**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Version:** 1.0

## Overview

A TypeScript SDK that provides a standardized interface for programmatically orchestrating multiple AI-powered CLI tools (OpenAI Codex and Claude Code) within software development workflows. Target launch: Today (MVP), with ongoing enhancement.

## Problem Statement

- **Problem:** Development teams cannot programmatically orchestrate multiple AI CLI tools together in automated workflows. Each tool has its own API surface, making it difficult to build reusable workflow scripts that leverage the strengths of different tools.
- **Why now:** AI coding assistants are mature enough for production use, but teams need to combine them strategically (e.g., Claude for implementation, OpenAI for review) rather than using them in isolation.
- **Cost of inaction:** Teams continue using AI tools manually, missing opportunities for automated code review, multi-agent validation, and sophisticated CI/CD integration that could accelerate development velocity.

## Objectives & Success Metrics

**Primary Objective:** Enable internal team to build automated multi-agent development workflows using a unified TypeScript interface.

**Key Metrics:**

- 3+ production workflows deployed using the SDK within 30 days
- <500ms overhead for SDK adapter layer vs direct CLI usage
- 100% feature parity for common operations (code generation, file editing, execution)

**Measurement Timeline:**

- Day 1: Core adapter pattern working with both tools
- Week 1: Internal team building first workflow scripts
- 30 days: SDK open-sourced with documentation and examples

## Users

**Primary Persona:** Internal development team members building automation workflows

- **Job to be done:** Automate code generation, review, and testing workflows by orchestrating multiple AI tools programmatically
- **Current frustrations:**
  - Each CLI tool requires different integration patterns
  - No way to swap tools without rewriting workflow logic
  - Manual CLI usage doesn't fit into CI/CD pipelines
  - Cannot combine strengths of different models (e.g., Claude writes, OpenAI reviews)

## Solution Requirements

| Requirement | Priority | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|------------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Unified Adapter Interface | P0 | As a developer, I want a common interface for both tools so that I can swap implementations without code changes | TypeScript interface defines common methods; both adapters implement it |
| Claude Code Adapter | P0 | As a developer, I want to call Claude Code programmatically so that I can use it in workflows | Custom adapter using child_process to invoke Claude CLI directly; supports --print mode, JSON output, streaming, and all modern Claude Code features |
| OpenAI Codex Adapter | P0 | As a developer, I want to call OpenAI Codex programmatically so that I can use it in workflows | Full adapter using @openai/codex-sdk; supports code generation, review |
| Tool-Specific Extensions | P0 | As a developer, I want to access unique features of each tool so that I'm not limited to lowest common denominator | Adapters expose tool-specific methods beyond common interface |
| Async Execution | P0 | As a developer, I want async/await patterns so that workflows integrate with Node.js naturally | All methods return Promises; proper error handling |
| Configuration Management | P1 | As a developer, I want to configure API keys and options once so that I don't repeat setup code | Factory pattern with config object; environment variable support |
| Workflow Composition | P1 | As a developer, I want to chain operations across tools so that I can build complex workflows | Helper utilities for sequential/parallel execution patterns |
| Error Handling | P1 | As a developer, I want consistent error handling so that I can build reliable workflows | Standardized error types; proper propagation; retry logic |
| Example Workflows | P1 | As a new user, I want example scripts so that I can understand usage patterns quickly | 3+ documented examples: simple, multi-agent, CI/CD integration |
| TypeScript Types | P1 | As a developer, I want full type safety so that I catch errors at compile time | Complete TypeScript definitions; exported types for config/responses |

**Priority Levels:**

- P0 (Must Have) - MVP blockers
- P1 (Should Have) - Important but not blockers
- P2 (Could Have) - Nice to have
- P3 (Won't Have) - Future consideration

## Technical Specification

### Architecture Approach

- **Type:** Library/SDK package distributed via npm
- **API Style:** Programmatic TypeScript API (not REST/HTTP)
- **Frontend:** N/A (Node.js server-side only)
- **Infrastructure:** Runs in Node.js 22+ environments

### Technical Decisions

- **Core Stack:** TypeScript 5.x for type safety and modern features
- **Adapter Pattern:** Inspired by Vercel AI SDK's provider model
- **Dependencies:**
  - Custom Claude Code adapter using Node.js `child_process` (no external dependencies)
  - `openai` SDK for OpenAI integration
  - Minimal additional deps for core functionality
- **Package Manager:** Support for npm/pnpm/yarn

### Integration Requirements

- **External Systems:**
  - Claude Code CLI (via direct `claude` command invocation with `--print` mode)
  - OpenAI API (via official `openai` SDK)
- **Authentication:**
  - Claude Code: Uses existing CLI authentication (no API keys needed in SDK)
  - OpenAI: API keys via config or environment variables
- **API Constraints:** Respect rate limits of underlying services; pass through to consumers

### Performance Requirements

- **Response Time:** <500ms adapter overhead (excluding actual AI inference)
- **Scale:** Support concurrent requests limited only by underlying API quotas
- **Availability:** No persistent state; availability determined by Claude/OpenAI services

### Security & Compliance

- **Data Privacy:** API keys never logged; support for secrets management patterns
- **Compliance:** No data stored by SDK; consumers responsible for their usage
- **Auth Requirements:** Pass-through authentication to underlying services; no SDK-level auth

## Constraints & Assumptions

**Constraints:**

- Limited to Node.js 22+ server environments (no browser support)
- Dependent on external API availability and rate limits
- Must maintain compatibility with upstream SDK changes

**Assumptions:**

- Users have Claude Code CLI installed and authenticated on their system
- Users have valid OpenAI API keys for OpenAI integration
- Users understand async programming patterns
- Claude Code CLI provides stable `--print` and JSON output modes
- Common operations across tools can be abstracted without significant feature loss

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| Claude Code CLI breaking changes | Medium | High | Document required CLI version; test against multiple versions; monitor Claude Code releases |
| Feature parity impossible | Low | Medium | Design allows tool-specific extensions beyond common interface |
| Performance overhead from abstraction | Low | Medium | Benchmark early; optimize adapter layer; use streaming where possible |
| Claude CLI not installed | Medium | Low | Provide clear installation docs; graceful error messages with setup instructions |

## Out of Scope

- Browser or edge runtime support (focus on Node.js server-side)
- Built-in workflow orchestration engine (users write their own scripts)
- Support for additional AI tools beyond Claude Code and OpenAI Codex in v1
- Persistent state management or caching layer
- Web UI or visual workflow builder
- Hosting or deployment infrastructure

## Definition of Done
