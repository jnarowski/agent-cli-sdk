# Feature: Workflow State Utilities

## What We're Building

Simple utility functions for managing workflow state, progress tracking, and recovery in ad-hoc multi-step agent workflows. Developers compose their own workflows using these lightweight helpers for state persistence, progress logging, and LLM integration.

## User Story

As a developer building multi-agent systems
I want simple utilities to track workflow state and progress
So that I can build custom workflows without framework overhead while maintaining observability and resumability

## Technical Approach

Provide minimal utility functions that:
1. Generate workflow IDs (UUIDs)
2. Read/write workflow state objects to disk as JSON
3. Provide console logging helpers for progress reporting
4. Integrate Vercel AI SDK as a simple helper function
5. Work seamlessly with existing adapter logging (workflow-{id}/step-{n} pattern)

Developers write their own workflow logic (like the example script provided) and call these utilities as needed. No orchestration engine, no step definitions - just helpful functions.

## Files to Touch

### Existing Files

- `src/index.ts` - Export workflow utilities (`generateWorkflowId`, `saveWorkflowState`, `loadWorkflowState`, workflow logging helpers)
- `src/types/index.ts` - Export basic workflow types
- `package.json` - Add `ai` (Vercel AI SDK) dependency

### New Files

- `src/types/workflow.ts` - Minimal type definitions (WorkflowState interface only)
- `src/utils/workflow-state.ts` - State persistence utilities (save/load JSON)
- `src/utils/workflow-logger.ts` - Console logging helpers (progress, errors, completion)
- `src/utils/ai-helper.ts` - Vercel AI SDK wrapper function
- `examples/workflow-custom.ts` - Example of custom workflow using utilities

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation

Create minimal type definitions for workflow state and add Vercel AI SDK dependency.

### Phase 2: Utility Functions

Implement simple utility functions for state persistence, workflow ID generation, and Vercel AI SDK integration.

### Phase 3: Logging Helpers

Add console logging helper functions for progress reporting (similar to the example script provided).

## Acceptance Criteria

**Must Work:**

- [ ] Create workflow with auto-generated UUID
- [ ] Execute steps sequentially with state updates after each step
- [ ] LLM steps execute via Vercel AI SDK with specified model
- [ ] Custom steps execute inline handler functions with access to state
- [ ] Adapter steps execute via existing Claude/Codex adapters
- [ ] State persists to disk after each step completion
- [ ] Resume workflow from saved state after failure
- [ ] Retry failed steps based on retry policy
- [ ] Console progress reporting shows step-by-step execution
- [ ] Integration with existing logging system (workflow-{id}/step-{n} pattern)
- [ ] All TypeScript types exported and usable

**Should Not:**

- [ ] Break existing adapter functionality
- [ ] Lose state data on crashes
- [ ] Execute steps out of order
- [ ] Block indefinitely on errors
- [ ] Create performance overhead >10% vs direct adapter usage

## Validation

Execute these commands to verify the feature works correctly:

**Automated Verification:**

```bash
# Build verification
pnpm build
# Expected: Clean build with no errors, workflow files compiled to dist/

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit
# Expected: No type errors

# Linting
pnpm lint
# Expected: No lint errors

# Unit tests
pnpm test
# Expected: All existing tests pass (new workflow tests to be added in future)
```

**Manual Verification:**

1. Start simple workflow: `npx tsx examples/workflow-simple.ts`
2. Verify: Console shows step-by-step progress
3. Verify: Workflow state file created in `./workflows/workflow-{id}/state.json`
4. Verify: Step logs created in `./workflows/workflow-{id}/step-{n}-{name}/`
5. Test error recovery: `npx tsx examples/workflow-with-recovery.ts`
6. Verify: Workflow pauses on error and saves state
7. Verify: Resume command works and continues from last successful step
8. Check: All JSON files are well-formed (use `jq` or JSON validator)

**Feature-Specific Checks:**

- Verify `state.json` contains complete workflow state with step results
- Verify LLM steps execute via Vercel AI SDK (check API calls)
- Verify adapter steps create standard log structure (input/output/stream)
- Verify custom steps receive correct state object
- Test workflow with 5+ steps to ensure sequential execution
- Simulate failure and verify retry policy works (attempts, backoff)
- Verify resumed workflow skips completed steps
- Check console output formatting is clear and informative

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tasks completed
- [ ] Build passes with no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Lint passes
- [ ] Manual testing confirms all workflow scenarios work
- [ ] State persistence verified (create, save, load, resume)
- [ ] Progress reporting displays correctly in console
- [ ] Error recovery tested (retry + resume)
- [ ] Integration with logging system verified
- [ ] Examples run successfully and demonstrate key features
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns (types/, workflow/ structure)
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing adapter APIs

## Notes

**Dependencies:**

- Vercel AI SDK (`ai` package) for LLM integration
- Zod for schema validation (Vercel AI SDK dependency)
- Requires Node.js `fs/promises` API (Node 14+)
- Works with existing Claude/Codex adapters

**Design Decisions:**

- **Simplicity First**: Start with basic retry and resume, avoid over-engineering
- **Sequential Only**: No parallel step execution in v1 (can add later)
- **Disk-Based State**: JSON files for now, database integration in future
- **Workflow ID Pattern**: Use existing UUID generation from logging examples
- **State Directory Structure**: `{stateDir}/workflow-{id}/state.json` and `{stateDir}/workflow-{id}/step-{n}-{name}/` for logs

**Future Considerations:**

- Parallel step execution (use existing `parallel` utility)
- Conditional step execution based on previous results
- Sub-workflows and workflow composition
- Database persistence instead of JSON files
- Web UI for workflow visualization and monitoring
- Workflow templates and presets
- Step dependency graphs
- Webhook notifications on workflow events
- Workflow scheduling and cron-like execution
- Advanced retry strategies (circuit breaker, fallback steps)

**Integration Notes:**

- Workflows automatically integrate with existing logging system
- Each step gets dedicated log directory following `workflow-{id}/step-{n}` pattern
- Adapter steps use existing `logPath` option for seamless integration
- State files use same directory structure for consistency
- Resume functionality works because state includes `currentStepIndex`

**Error Handling Strategy:**

- LLM API errors: Retry with backoff (configurable)
- Custom step errors: Capture and pause workflow
- Adapter errors: Use existing error types, retry if configured
- State persistence errors: Log to stderr, continue execution
- Invalid resume: Throw error with helpful message
